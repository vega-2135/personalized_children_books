# Development Log

## March 17, 2024

### Completed Tasks
1. Set up basic project structure
2. Created story templates with placeholders
3. Implemented navigation and app layout
4. Created preview page for story display
5. Set up illustration generation service with Stability AI integration

### Current Issues
1. Environment variable handling for API keys
   - Added `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix to environment variables
   - Still experiencing issues with API key access in client-side code
   - Need to investigate alternative approaches for handling API keys

### Next Steps
1. Fix API key handling
   - Consider using API routes instead of client-side API calls
   - Or implement a secure way to handle API keys in the client
2. Test illustration generation
   - Verify API integration
   - Test with different story templates
3. Add error handling
   - Implement proper error states
   - Add user feedback for failed API calls
4. Add loading states
   - Show progress during illustration generation
   - Add timeout handling for long-running requests

### Technical Notes
- Using Next.js 14.2.24
- Environment variables are configured in `.env` file
- API key is stored as `NEXT_PUBLIC_STABILITY_API_KEY`
- Current error: "API key is required" in `IllustrationService`

### Commands Used

# Start development server
npm run dev
